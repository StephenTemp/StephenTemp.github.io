I am a grateful alumni of the **Socially-Intelligent Media & Systems Lab** (SIMs), where I primarily worked on analyzing social polling and leveraging participant characteristics to predict election outcomes. Blog posts about this work will eventually be posted on the lab's substack, [Uncommon Good](https://uncommongood.substack.com).

This substack (and SIMs broadly) concerns itself with **reconciling technology with society**: introducing fair machine learning algorithms, suggesting AI policy practices, and improving social media. At the time of writing, there are three posts written by my advisor [Przemyslaw Grabowicz](https://przemyslslaw.github.io) and colleague [Nicholas Perello](https://nperello.github.io) concerning fair machine learning practices in a post-affirmative action context.
