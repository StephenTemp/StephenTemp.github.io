I'm Stephen Scarano, a postgrad (M.S) of Computer Science and Bay State Fellow from the University of Massachusettes, Amherst. My interests span both **traditional** and **deep machine learning** algorithms, **computer vision**, and **responsible AI**.

Background
======
I'm originally from Harvard, MA (not the school) and after completing my bachelor's of science at UMass Amherst, I was a grateful recipient of a [Bay State Fellowship](https://www.cics.umass.edu/content/bay-state-scholarship-program), which allowed me to continue my education further. 

In graduate school I took an interest in ironing-out the failings of contemporary machine learning algorithms. While my work in Responsible AI has accentuated and formalized these problems, my prior work in computer vision reminds me *why these methods were attractive in the first place*. There are simply many problems (particularly describing *qualitative* phenomena) where traditional methods fall flat. The goal, then, is to innovate intentionally for the best of both worlds. 

Education
======
I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
