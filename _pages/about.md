I'm Stephen Scarano, a postgrad (M.S) of Computer Science and Bay State Fellow from the University of Massachusettes, Amherst. My research interests leverage **computer vision** and **signal processing** for robust perception of the outside world with applications spanning robotics, neurmorphic tracking, and online polling. I work at the [Noblis Autonomy Lab](https://noblis.org/what-we-do/capabilities/autonomy/) creating vision solitions for internal R&D, U.S DOT, and NASA. I'm currently applying for Phds this Fall!

Background
======
I'm originally from Harvard, MA (not the school) and after completing my bachelor's of science at UMass Amherst, I was a grateful recipient of a [Bay State Fellowship](https://www.cics.umass.edu/content/bay-state-scholarship-program), which allowed me to continue my education further. 

In graduate school I took an interest in ironing-out the failings of contemporary machine learning algorithms. While my work in Responsible AI has accentuated and formalized these problems, my prior work in computer vision reminds me *why these methods were attractive in the first place*. There are simply many problems (particularly describing *qualitative* phenomena) where traditional methods fall flat. The goal, then, is to innovate intentionally for the best of both worlds. 

Education
======
I completed both my Master's degrees and Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
