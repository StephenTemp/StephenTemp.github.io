I'm originally from Harvard, MA (not the school) and after completing my bachelor's of science at UMass Amherst, I was a grateful recipient of a Bay State Fellowship, which allowed me to continue my education further. \\

In graduate school I took an interest in ironing-out the failings of contemporary machine learning algorithms. While my work in Responsible AI has accentuated and formalized these problems, my prior work in Computer Vision reminds me why these methods were attractive in the first place. There are simply many problems (particularly describing qualitative phenomena) where traditional methods fall flat. The goal, then, is to innovate intentionally for the best of both worlds. 

Research Labs

I've had the privilege to work with Professors Przemek Grabowicz and Erik Learned-Miller of the **Knowledge Discovery** and **Computer Vision** Labs respectively.

Education
-----
I received my Master's and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in tandem with the commonwealth honors college. Now, I'm grateful to be a [Bay state Fellow](https://www.cics.umass.edu/content/bay-state-scholarship-program) and computer science masters student at UMass Amherst on track for a Spring 2023 graduation.
