Education
======
* **M.S.** in Computer Science with Concentration in Data Science, University of Massachusetts Amehrst, 2023
* **B.S.** in Computer Science with Commonwealth Honors, University of Massachusetts Amehrst, 2021

Work experience
======

* <ins> 2021-2023: Research Data Scientist </ins>
  * **Employer:** Socially-Intelligent Media & Systems Lab (SIMs)
  * **Responsibilities:** Principal investigator into research focussed on social media polling and leveraging machine learning and tradsitional statistics to improve election prediction.
  * **Supervisor**: Professor [Przemyslaw Grabowicz](https://przemyslslaw.github.io/)

* <ins> Summer 2023: Machine Learning Engineer </ins>
  * **Employer:** Center for Data Science
  * **Responsibilities:** _Data Science for the Common Good_ (DS4CG) is a summer program–managed by the University of Massachusetts, Amherst's Center for Data Science–that trains aspiring data scientists to work on real-world problems that benefit the common good. I implemented and produced traditional machine learning and Gaussian processes to forecast property emissions data for the Massachusetts Department of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance (DCAMM).
  * **Supervisors**: [Purva Pruthi](https://purvapruthi.github.io), [Erin Bartuska](https://purvapruthi.github.io)

* <ins> 2021: Research Assistant </ins>
  * **Employer:** University of Massachusetts, Amherst Computer Vision Lab
  * **Responsibilities:**  I created a novel, highly-reliable dataset for rotation and translation estimation using optical flow. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art rotation estimation methods using only video data.
  * **Supervisor**: Professor [Erik Learned-Miller](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/)
  
Skills
======
* **Machine Learning:** skill in PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn, vectorization, transformers, AWS
* **Data Science:** linear regression, Gaussian processes, prediction, neural networks, deep learning, and optimization
* **Computer Vision:** optical flow, SLAM, CNNs, classification, object detection/segmentation, and 3D-deep learning techniques
* **Programming:** proficiency in Python, R, C, C#, C++, Java, Javascript, Julia, and Jupyter Notebooks
