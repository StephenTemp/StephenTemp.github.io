### Teaching Experience 
- **Responsible AI**
Teaching Assistant (2023)
Summary: In this course, students will learn techniques for robust model evaluation, model selection, causal discovery, explainable and fair artificial intelligence, and interpretable models. In addition, students will reason about representativeness, transparency, and legal aspects of techno-social systems. The course will review both cutting-edge research and relevant portions of recent open-access textbooks. Coursework includes reading recent research papers, programming assignments, and a final group project. After completing the course, students should be able to develop, investigate, evaluate, and deploy artificial intelligence systems more responsibly.

- **Introduction to Computation**
Teaching Assistant (2022)
Summary: In addition to basic programming constructs such as looping, conditions, arrays, file handling, and methods, much attention is given to the Java object model as well as to Java’s event model and its relation to graphical user interfaces.
