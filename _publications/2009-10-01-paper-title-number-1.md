title: "Robust Frame-to-Frame Camera Rotation Estimation in Crowded Scenes"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'We present an approach to estimating camera rotation in crowded, real-world scenes from handheld monocular video. While camera rotation estimation is a well-studied problem, no previous methods exhibit both high accuracy and acceptable speed in this setting. Because the setting is not addressed well by other datasets, we provide a new dataset and benchmark, with high-accuracy, rigorously verified ground truth, on 17 video sequences.'
