Abstract
=====

Polls posted on social media have emerged in recent years as an important tool for estimating public opinion, e.g., to gauge public support for business deci- sions and political candidates in national elections. Here, we examine nearly two thousand Twitter polls gauging support for U.S. presidential candidates during the 2016 and 2020 election campaigns. First, we describe the rapidly emerging prevalence of social polls. Second, we characterize social polls in terms of their heterogeneity and response options. Third, leveraging machine learning models for user attribute inference, we describe the demographics, po- litical leanings, and other characteristics of the users who author and interact with social polls. Finally, we study the relationship between social poll results, their attributes, and the characteristics of users interacting with them. Our findings reveal that Twitter polls are biased in various ways, starting from the position of the presidential candidates among the poll options, to biases in demographic attributes and poll results. 

The 2016 and 2020 polls were pre- dominantly crafted by older males and manifested a pronounced bias favoring candidate Donald Trump, in contrast to traditional surveys, which favored Democratic candidates. We further identify and explore the potential reasons for such biases in social polling and discuss their potential repercussions.
